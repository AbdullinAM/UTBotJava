**Please, describe the problem to be solved**

Substitute this text with a concise description of the problem. Please be clear what parts of the problem are considered to be in-scope and out-of-scope.

_Example:_ Sometimes engine does not emit any tests. Seems that in such situations we can use a fuzzer.

**Solution you'd like**

Substitute the text with a clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

_Example:_ We can significantly improve coverage with a smart fuzzer. We can not only feed the API under test with a corner case data but analyze the control-flows graph in order to find additional data to fuzz .

**Alternatives you've considered**

Substitute this text with a potential alternative to the solution.

_Example:_ We can use more simple version of a fuzzer that just finds corner cases for primitives.

**Context**

Substitute this text with any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

_Example:_  You can execute test generation for a complex example. Stop the generation in several seconds after the start.
